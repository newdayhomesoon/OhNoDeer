/**
 * Get the current receipt base64 encoded in IOS.
 *
 * The sequence should be as follows:
 * Call getReceiptIOS({forceRefresh: false}). That will return the cached receipt that is available on TestFlight and Production.
 * In the case of Sandbox the receipt might not be cached, causing it to return nil.
 * In that case you might want to let the user that they will to be prompted for credentials.
 * If they accept, call it again with `getReceiptIOS({forceRefresh:true}) If it fails or the user declines, assume they haven't purchased any items.
 * Reference: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/662350
 *
 * From: https://apphud.com/blog/app-store-receipt-validation#what-is-app-store-receipt
 > Q: Does a receipt always exist in the app?
 > A: If a user downloaded the app from the App Store â€“ yes. However, in sandbox if your app was installed via Xcode or Testflight, then there won't be a receipt until you make a purchase or restore.

 ## Usage
 ```tsx
import {getReceiptIOS} from 'react-native-iap';
try{
  let receipt = await getReceiptIOS({forceRefresh: false});
  if(!receipt){
    // Let user know that they might get prompted for credentials
    const shouldShowPrompt = // Display UI with details, Did user agree?. this only for Sandbox testing
    if(shouldShowPrompt){
      receipt = await getReceiptIOS({forceRefresh: true});
    }
  }
}catch(error:Error){
  // error while getting the receipt, it might indicate an invalid receipt of a connection error while trying to get it
}
// If !receipt assume user doesn't own the items
```
 * @param {forceRefresh?:boolean} Requests the receipt from Bundle.main.appStoreReceiptURL.
Based on the note above, looks like forceRefresh only makes sense when testing an app not downloaded from the Appstore.
And only afer a direct user action.
 * @returns {Promise<string | undefined | null>} The receipt data
